 * @on_channel_cleanup: is invoked to cleanup user allocated state
 *
 * The overall call flow is as follow:
 *
 * Upon receiving a connection request from client framework accepts it and
 * validates against configured ACL rules. If connection is allowed, the
 * framework allocates a channel tracking structure and invokes an optional
 * @on_connect callback if specified. The user who choose to implement this
 * callback can allocate its own tracking structure and return pointer to that
 * through @ctx_p parameter. After that this pointer will be associated with
 * particular channel and it will be passed to all other callbacks.
 *
 * Upon receiving a message directed to particular channel, a corresponding
 * @on_message callback is invoked so this message can be handled according
 * with application specific protocol. The @on_message call back is a
 * mandatory in this implementation.
 *
 * Upon receiving a disconnect request an optional @on_disconnect callback is
 * invoked to indicate that peer closed connection. At this point the channel
 * is still alive but in disconnected state, it will be closed by framework
 * after control returns from executing this callback.
 *
 * The @on_channel_cleanup callback is invoked by framework to give the user
 * a chance to release channel specific resources if allocated by
 * @on_connect callback, after the channel have been closed. This
 * callback is mandatory if the user implements @on_connect callback and
 * allocates per channel state.
 *
 * Note: an application implementing these callbacks MUST not close channel
 * received as @chan parameter directly, instead it should return an error
 * and the channel will be closed by the framework.
